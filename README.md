# 🦁 Welcome to the Lunar Lions Team Repo for the NASA SUITS Challenge (2026)! 🚀💻
This repo is for developing our EVA Astronaut assistance program on the Magic Leap 2

### Introduction
ROARR, Space Cadets! You've landed in the cosmic command center of Team Lunar Lions of the Columbia Space Initiative, boldly venturing into the NASA SUITS (Spacesuit User Interface Technologies for Students) Challenge for the stellar year 2025-26! Prepare for an intergalactic coding adventure.

### Contribution Guidelines
To navigate the stars with us, here are the rules for contributing to the NASA SUITS repository:

#### 1. Branching Strategy
- 🌲 Ensure that each subteam has their own branch for your cosmic contributions. Ideally, each subteam will also have 1 or more feature branches that will submit PR to your subteam branch.
  Example: `main <-- LTV (subteam branch) <-- CV-scripts (feature branch)` 

- 📬 If you're feeling lost in the cosmic sea, signal our wise leaders - Hiba or Grace, to receive your territory in the codebase!

#### 2. Unity Etiquette 🚀 
- Each subteam branch should have their own README.md files that gives a brief overview of the code's features, how to setup, AND the libraries (with their versions) you imported.
- ALWAYS close Unity before committing and pushing to your branch. Let's avoid space-time paradoxes and keep our coding universe in order.
- Add any unnecessary generated files (like build, log, memory captures, or mac DS files) to .gitignore. This will make merging a lot easier! Remember to leave scene, config & obj files so people can properly run your code!
- Make sure to be on `Unity Editor Version 2022.3.7` or higher. 

#### 3. Merging to Main
- 🚀 Merges to the main branch will be celebrated during our out-of-this-world group meetings. Keep your creations on your own branch until the cosmic council approves a merge.
